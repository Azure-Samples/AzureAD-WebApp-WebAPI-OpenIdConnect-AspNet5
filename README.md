# Call a web API in an ASP.NET Core web app using Azure AD

**There's a newer version of this sample taking advantage of the Microsoft identity platform** (formerly Azure AD v2.0)
Check it out: https://github.com/Azure-Samples/active-directory-aspnetcore-webapp-openidconnect-v2/tree/master/4-WebApp-your-API

If you really need to access this Azure AD v1.0, you can navigate to the [master](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/active-directory-dotnet-webapp-webapi-openidconnect-aspnetcore/tree/master) branch, but please know that it's no longer supported.
